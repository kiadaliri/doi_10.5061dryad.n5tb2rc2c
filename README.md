dataset file kiadaliri-NJB.

In this study, the ecological effects of the road on some physical and chemical properties of the soil, and the biodiversity of plants (herbaceous cover, tree regeneration and lichen) with Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalf's richness index and uniformity index Pielou's evenness index was investigated in Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran. The dataset file contains information on the physical and chemical properties of the soil, and plant biodiversity numbers (herbaceous cover, tree regeneration and lichen) with Shannon's biodiversity index, Margalf's richness index, and Pelo's uniformity index (Excel file). The Appendix file contains the tables of the frequency of tree regeneration (Table 1), herbaceous cover (Table 2), and lichen (Table 3) in the two harvestrd and control areas.
Distances from the side of the road: D0 (side of the road), D15 (15 meters from the roadside), D45 (45 meters from the side of the road), D75 (75 meters from the side of the road) and D105 (105 meters from the side of the road),  Physical properties (BD: bulk density; PR: penetration resistance; TP: total porosity and SM: soil moisture, ), chemical properties (C: organic C; N: nitrogen content; P: available phosphorous; K: available potassium; Ca: available calcium; Mg: available magnesium)
In this study, a set of collected field and laboratory data was used to obtain vegetation and soil information. Sampling has been done by implementing plots along the line of transects at different distances from the road edge (0, 45, 75 and 105 meters). Soil, herbaceous and lichen samples were collected in these plots.
The results showed that harvesting caused the destruction and reduction of tree, herbaceous and lichen regeneration, but the physical and chemical properties of the soil were not affected. The distance from the road has affected the diversity and richness of herbaceous and lichen, tree regeneration and all physical and chemical characteristics of the soil (except C). There was a significant correlation between most of the physical and chemical properties of the soil with the regeneration of trees and herbaceous species. Also, most of the physical and chemical properties of soil have increased with increasing distance from the road. Results showed that the buffering effect of the roadside in these forests up to a distance of 45 meters had an effect on diversity and richness. Also, the results of this study are consistent with the fact that the road affects the biodiversity and properties of the forest soil.
